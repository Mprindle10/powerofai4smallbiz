**Question 4:** Have you tried solving this before?
[MULTIPLE CHOICE:

- I'm not sure where to start]

**Question 5:** If we could solve [THEIR CHALLENGE] for you, what would that mean for your business?
[TEXT INPUT]

**Question 6:** What's your timeline for addressing this?
[MULTIPLE CHOICE:
- ASAP - this is urgent
- Within the next month

- Just exploring options]

→ Based on responses, route to appropriate follow-up:

**HIGH PRIORITY (urgent timeline + clear problem):**
BOT: Based on your responses, this sounds like exactly what we specialize in! 

Given your timeline, I'd recommend we get you on a call with [NAME] this week. They can walk you through our proven process for [THEIR CHALLENGE] and show you exactly how we'd tackle your situation.

I have availability [TODAY/TOMORROW] at [TIME] or [DAY] at [TIME]. Which works better?

Our [SERVICE TYPE] typically ranges from $[X] to $[Y] depending on scope. Is that within the range you were expecting?

[BUTTONS: Yes, that's what I expected | That's higher than I thought | That's lower than I expected | I need to understand the value first]

BOT: I understand! It's important to make sure any investment makes sense for your business.

Let me put this in perspective: if we help you [ACHIEVE MAIN OUTCOME], what would that be worth to your business over the next year?

[TEXT INPUT]

[BUTTONS: I make the decisions | I decide with my business partner | I need to discuss with my spouse | It depends on the amount]

→ IF involves others:
