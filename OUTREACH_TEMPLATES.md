Subject: [Restaurant Name] - Save 5+ hours weekly on social media & customer service

Hi [Owner Name],

I noticed [Restaurant Name] has incredible reviews on Google! 

Quick question - how much time does your team spend each week on:
• Creating social media posts about daily specials
• Responding to customer questions/reviews
• Writing menu descriptions that sell

I help [Your City] restaurants automate these tasks with simple AI tools. [Local Restaurant Example] just saved 6 hours weekly and increased takeout orders by 23%.

Worth a 15-minute demo showing exactly how they did it?

Best,
